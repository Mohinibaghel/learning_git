this is my 4th day of learning git 
hello

Aspect
Git checkout 
Git switch
Main Purpose 
Like changing our outfit and cleaning your room at the same time. It does both things.
Like only changing your outfit. No room cleaning. 
Switch to Existing Branch
Git checkout <branch> is like picking a new outfit (switching tasks).
Git switch <branch> is also like picking a new outfit and putting it on.
Create New Branch
Git checkout -b <new-branch> is like making a new outfit and wearing it right away.
Git switch -c <new-branch> is like making a new outfit and putting it on.
Restore Files
Git checkout <file> is like cleaning up a messy room (fixing a file).
Cannot clean the room (no file fixing allowed here).
Detached HEAD (switch to commit)
Git checkout <commit-hash> is like looking at an old photo album (going back in time to an older task).
Git switch –detach <commit-hash> is the same as going back in the time but no changing things.
Simplicity 
Like doing two things at once (can change outfit and clean the room).
Only for changing outfits (easy and focused).
Accidental File Changes
You might accidentally clean something you didn’t want to, like cleaning your favorite toy.
No risk here, just changing outfits, so no accidents.
